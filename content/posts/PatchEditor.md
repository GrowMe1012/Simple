Some points :

1) Idea about what you want to do.

2) Then think of starting patch mostly interactive or object patches(the ones in which you drag objects directly in the patch editor).

3)Then think of next and it can literally be anything just go through options and search for that particular patch.

4)Property patches from inspector of objects/materials also play a role many times(almost all times).{click on the arrow}.

5)Try,Test and Debug .


**Just practice and do some examples on your own and automatically concepts will start getting clear**
